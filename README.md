# Pythagoreas-theroem-hypotnuse-calculator
to find the hypotenuse o a right angled triangle using Pythagoras theorem
In maths, to find the length of the hpotenuse of the right angled trinagle we use pythagores theroem
in the theroem we add the sqaure number of the base,height(lenghth)
the number received we find the sqaure root which will give the length of the hypotnuse
